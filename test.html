	<h1> The Beginning </h1>
	<p>Ever since I was a young-man i've wanted to learn how to create things at its base form, I always wanted to understand how things worked, Because at heart I am a philosopher and subscribe to the <b> Teachings of Socrates </b> of always questioning why about everything. So here I am, with my own website listing to you my past and future accomplishments and goals!</p>
